Morse code

Morse code is a method of encoding textual information through a series of short and long signals, known as "dots" and "dashes." Originally developed in the 1830s by Samuel F.B. Morse and his collaborators, the system was designed for use with telegraphs and has since been adapted for use in various forms of communication, including audio tones and visual signals. Each letter of the alphabet, as well as numbers and punctuation, is represented by a unique combination of these signals. While Morse code was initially created for English, it has been adapted to suit many other languages, such as Arabic, Hebrew, and Japanese.

International Morse Code is the most commonly used version today, differing from American Morse Code in its transmission method. The code can also be employed in emergencies, with the SOS signal being one of the most recognized distress calls. Although its use has declined with the advent of modern communication technologies, learning Morse code remains a popular hobby among amateur radio enthusiasts, and it continues to play a role in specific operational contexts, such as maritime communication. Recent updates to Morse code even include the addition of the @ symbol, reflecting the impact of digital communication advancements.
